## JIT Datasource

A just-in-time datasource for Mapnik. It takes bboxes,
deciphers tiles, downloads and parses GeoJSON.

### Building

if you've got a similar install to me, you can run

    make do

and rebuild and install in one swipe.

### Components

Includes [yajl](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/) for
JSON parsing.
